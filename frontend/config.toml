# Below are all the sections and options you can have in ~/.streamlit/config.toml.

[global]

# By default, Streamlit checks if the Python watchdog module is available and, if not, prints a warning asking for you to install it. The watchdog module is not required, but highly recommended. It improves Streamlit's ability to detect changes to files in your filesystem.
# If you'd like to turn off this warning, set this to True.
# Default: false
disableWatchdogWarning = false

# Configure the ability to share apps to the cloud.
# Should be set to one of these values: - "off" : turn off sharing. - "s3" : share to S3, based on the settings under the [s3] section of this config file.
# Default: "off"
sharingMode = "off"

# If True, will show a warning when you run a Streamlit-enabled script via "python my_script.py".
# Default: true
showWarningOnDirectExecution = true


[logger]

# Level of logging: 'error', 'warning', 'info', or 'debug'.
# Default: 'info'
level = "debug"


[client]

# Whether to enable st.cache.
# Default: true

# If false, makes your Streamlit script not draw to a Streamlit app.
# Default: true
displayEnabled = true


[runner]

# Allows you to type a variable or string by itself in a single line of Python code to write it to the app.
# Default: true
magicEnabled = true

# Install a Python tracer to allow you to stop or pause your script at any point and introspect it. As a side-effect, this slows down your script's execution.
# Default: false
installTracer = false

# Sets the MPLBACKEND environment variable to Agg inside Streamlit to prevent Python crashing.
# Default: true
fixMatplotlib = true


[server]

# List of folders that should not be watched for changes. Relative paths will be taken as relative to the current working directory.
# Example: ['/home/user1/env', 'relative/path/to/folder']
# Default: []
folderWatchBlacklist = ['']



# If false, will attempt to open a browser window on start.
# Default: false unless (1) we are on a Linux box where DISPLAY is unset, or (2) server.liveSave is set.
headless = true

# Immediately share the app in such a way that enables live monitoring, and post-run analysis.
# Default: false
liveSave = false

# Automatically rerun script when the file is modified on disk.
# Default: false
runOnSave = false

# The port where the server will listen for client and browser connections.
# Default: 8501
port = 80

# Enables support for Cross-Origin Request Sharing, for added security.
# Default: true
enableCORS = true


[browser]

# Internet address of the server server that the browser should connect to. Can be IP address or DNS name.
# Default: 'localhost'
serverAddress = "0.0.0.0"

# Whether to send usage statistics to Streamlit.
# Default: true
gatherUsageStats = true

# Port that the browser should use to connect to the server when in liveSave mode.
# Default: whatever value is set in server.port.
serverPort = 80

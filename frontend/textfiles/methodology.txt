An artificial intelligence model is used to estimate the position of three keypoints on the body for every frame in the video. 
We use machine learning to detect in which frames of the video the lowest point in the cycling motion is reached.
For these frames we calculate the knee-angle based on the three keypoints. This results in many estimates for the knee-angle.

Because each individual estimate of the knee-angle might contain some noise, we average all the estimates and use this for our final recommendation.

In the graph below you can see a histogram of all angles calculated at the lowest point. 
Ideally these are centered around the average, indicated by the dotted vertical line.
The solid blue line is a smooth estimate of the errors for the uploaded video. 
Ideally it should resemble the curve of the solid black line, which is a curve showing an idealized distrubution of errors. 
If the blue curve differs significantly from the black curve, please check that the set-up you used resembles the set-up we used for development of the model.

145Â° was chosen as a comfortable angle based on the following reference:
